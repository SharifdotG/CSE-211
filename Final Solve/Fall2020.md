# CSE 211 - Final Solve (Query and Relational Algebra Only) - Fall 2020 [Question: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Yq3Whex3xxwY280uROPQMq0MnWeAhHzN/view?usp=drive_link]

## 3. The following relational schema form a part of a software company database held in a relational DBMS

```s
Product (Prod_ID (PK), Prod_Name, Prod_Version, Prod_Price)
Developer (Dev_ID (PK), Dev_Name, Prod_ID (FK), T_ID (FK))
Manager (M_ID (PK), M_Name, Prod_ID (FK))
Technology (T_ID (PK), Platform, IDE)
```

Please write down the DML statements (MySQL) for the following queries:
a. Find the developer’s name who is working in the Windows platform and his/her ID is equal to the last 6 digits of your own registration number.
b. Show the names of managers working on a product resulting an app named “FilterCamera” with version number equal to your own registration number divided by 9 (please calculate the fractional number on your calculator).
c. Find the names of the developers start with the first letter of your own first name and end with the last letter of your own last name.
d. List the products developed in the IDE named Microsoft Visual Studio and the product name’s length is equal to the length of your own full name.
e. Find the most expensive products managed by you. Please use your own registration number as M_ID.
f. List the Apple product names but not the Samsung ones.

**Solution:**

a. Find the developer’s name who is working in the Windows platform and his/her ID is equal to the last 6 digits of your own registration number.

```sql
SELECT Dev_Name
FROM Developer
WHERE T_ID = 'Windows' AND Dev_ID = 110128;
```

b. Show the names of managers working on a product resulting an app named “FilterCamera” with version number equal to your own registration number divided by 9 (please calculate the fractional number on your calculator).

```sql
SELECT M_Name
FROM Manager
WHERE Prod_ID = 'FilterCamera' AND Prod_Version = 2455680.89;
```

c. Find the names of the developers start with the first letter of your own first name and end with the last letter of your own last name.

```sql
SELECT Dev_Name
FROM Developer
WHERE Dev_Name LIKE 'S%f';
```

d. List the products developed in the IDE named Microsoft Visual Studio and the product name’s length is equal to the length of your own full name.

```sql
SELECT Prod_Name
FROM Product
WHERE Prod_Name LIKE 'Microsoft Visual Studio' AND LENGTH(Prod_Name) = 17;
```

e. Find the most expensive products managed by you. Please use your own registration number as M_ID.

```sql
SELECT Prod_Name
FROM Product
WHERE Prod_Price = (
    SELECT MAX(Prod_Price)
    FROM Product
    WHERE M_ID = 22101128
);
```

f. List the Apple product names but not the Samsung ones.

```sql
SELECT Prod_Name
FROM Product
WHERE Prod_Name LIKE 'Apple%' AND Prod_Name NOT LIKE 'Samsung%';
```

## 3 OR. The following relational schema form a part of a software company database held in a relational DBMS

```s
Product (Prod_ID (PK), Prod_Name, Prod_Version, Prod_Price)
Developer (Dev_ID (PK), Dev_Name, Prod_ID (FK), T_ID (FK))
Manager (M_ID (PK), M_Name, Prod_ID (FK))
Technology (T_ID (PK), Platform, IDE)
```

Please write down the Relational Algebra for the following queries:
a. Find the names of the developers working on a product having product ID same as your own registration number.
b. Show the price of the product having the product ID same as the last 3 digits of your own registration number.
c. List the product names where the developers’ last names match with your own last name.
d. Find the developers’ ID working on both Windows and Linux platforms.
e. Show the developers’ names working on the Android Studio IDE but not on the Microsoft Visual Studio IDE.
f. List the developers’ ID working on either Mobile or Web platforms.

**Solution:**

a. Find the names of the developers working on a product having product ID same as your own registration number.

```s
π Dev_Name (σ Prod_ID = 22101128 (Developer))
```

b. Show the price of the product having the product ID same as the last 3 digits of your own registration number.

```s
π Prod_Price (σ Prod_ID = 128 (Product))
```

c. List the product names where the developers’ last names match with your own last name.

```s
π Prod_Name (σ Dev_Name = 'Yousuf' (Product ⨝ Developer))
```

d. Find the developers’ ID working on both Windows and Linux platforms.

```s
π Dev_ID (σ Platform = 'Windows' (Technology)) ∩ π Dev_ID (σ Platform = 'Linux' (Technology))
```

e. Show the developers’ names working on the Android Studio IDE but not on the Microsoft Visual Studio IDE.

```s
π Dev_Name (σ IDE = 'Android Studio' ^ IDE ≠ 'Microsoft Visual Studio' (Developer ⨝ Technology))
```

f. List the developers’ ID working on either Mobile or Web platforms.

```s
π Dev_ID (σ Platform = 'Mobile' (Technology)) ∪ π Dev_ID (σ Platform = 'Web' (Technology))
```
