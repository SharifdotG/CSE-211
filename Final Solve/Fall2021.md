Operator (O_ID (PK), O_Name, O_Address, O_Phone_Number)
Booking (B_ID (PK) , P_ID (FK), T_ID (FK), O_ID (FK))
```

Please write down the Relational Algebra for the following queries:
a. Show the tour package prices of tours in Maldives for 4 days.

c. Show the tourist's name where his/her phone number is 01612345678.
d. List the tour operators' names and phone numbers who are located at Gulshan-2.
e. Find the booking IDs maintained by an operator whose ID is 017.

**Solution:**

a. Show the tour package prices of tours in Maldives for 4 days.

```s
π P_Price (σ P_Destination = 'Maldives' ^ P_Days = 4 (Package))
```

b. Find the profession of a tourist whose ID is 53124.

```s
π T_Profession (σ T_ID = 53124 (Tourist))
```

c. Show the tourist's name where his/her phone number is 01612345678.

```s
π T_Name (σ T_Phone_Number = '01612345678' (Tourist))
```

d. List the tour operators' names and phone numbers who are located at Gulshan-2.

```s
π O_Name, O_Phone_Number (σ O_Address = 'Gulshan-2' (Operator))
```

e. Find the booking IDs maintained by an operator whose ID is 017.

```s
π B_ID (σ O_ID = 017 (Booking))
```

## 3. The following relational schema form a portion of a university database held in a relational database system

```s
Package (P_ID (PK), P_Destination, P_Days, P_Price)
Tourist (T_ID (PK), T_Name, T_Profession, T_Address, T_Phone_Number)
Operator (O_ID (PK), O_Name, O_Address, O_Phone_Number)
Booking (B_ID (PK) , P_ID (FK), T_ID (FK), O_ID (FK))
```

Please write down the DML statements (MySQL) for the following queries:
a. Find all the places with package price between 15,000 taka to 45,000 taka.
b. Show the package days available for Cox's Bazar tours.
c. Using Join operation, list the tourists' professions who booked Sundarbans tours.
d. Find the details of tour operators whose name started with 'B' and ended with 'd'
e. List the booking IDs and package IDs sorted by the descending order of the package IDs.

**Solution:**

a. Find all the places with package price between 15,000 taka to 45,000 taka.

```sql
SELECT P_Destination
FROM Package
WHERE P_Price BETWEEN 15000 AND 45000;
```

b. Show the package days available for Cox's Bazar tours.

```sql
SELECT P_Days
FROM Package
WHERE P_Destination = 'Cox''s Bazar';
```

c. Using Join operation, list the tourists' professions who booked Sundarbans tours.

```sql
SELECT T_Profession
FROM Tourist
JOIN Booking ON Tourist.T_ID = Booking.T_ID
JOIN Package ON Booking.P_ID = Package.P_ID
WHERE P_Destination = 'Sundarbans';
```

d. Find the details of tour operators whose name started with 'B' and ended with 'd'

```sql
SELECT *
FROM Operator
WHERE O_Name LIKE 'B%d';
```

e. List the booking IDs and package IDs sorted by the descending order of the package IDs.

```sql
SELECT B_ID, P_ID
FROM Booking
ORDER BY P_ID DESC;
```

## 4. The following relational schema form a portion of a university database held in a relational database system

```s
Package (P_ID (PK), P_Destination, P_Days, P_Price)
Tourist (T_ID (PK), T_Name, T_Profession, T_Address, T_Phone_Number)
Operator (O_ID (PK), O_Name, O_Address, O_Phone_Number)
Booking (B_ID (PK) , P_ID (FK), T_ID (FK), O_ID (FK))
```

AND P_ID NOT IN (
    SELECT P_ID 
    FROM Package 
    WHERE P_Destination = 'Malaysia'
);
```

b. Show the average tour package price for each destination.

```sql
SELECT P_Destination, AVG(P_Price) AS Average_Price
FROM Package
GROUP BY P_Destination;
```

c. Count the number of tourists who are students by profession.

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS Number_Of_Students
FROM Tourist
WHERE T_Profession = 'Student';
```

d. Using subquery, find tourists' names whose addresses match with tour operators' addresses.

```sql
SELECT T_Name
FROM Tourist
WHERE T_Address IN (
    SELECT O_Address
    FROM Operator
);
```

e. Delete booking details for booking ID as 0102030.

```sql
DELETE FROM Booking
WHERE B_ID = '0102030';
```
